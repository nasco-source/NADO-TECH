                    <p> Great communication always starts with an idea. The right idea, the one that encapsulates your strategy in the most compelling way will anchor your communication, engage your audience and realise your ambitions. As we’re an integrated agency, there’s no limit to how that idea can be expressed. we’ll use whichever channels of communication work best to bring your idea to life.</p>

                    <p>Once we have all the raw information we can get our hands on it’s time to create some clarity. We’ll analyse the insight we’ve received and the challenges it reveals. If necessary, we’ll question our clients thinking, as well as testing our own. By doing so we can start to develop a strategy simplifying things, making sense of things and defining the direction we should go in. </p>

                    <h2 class="round">Creating Understanding</h2>
                    <p>Every client has different ambitions. They operate in different sectors, speak to different audiences, are built around different structures and are controlled by different personalities. That’s why, when we start working with a client, we’ll ask questions, lots of questions. We interrogate, interview and research. Most importantly we listen until we understand. And then we might ask some more questions.</p>
